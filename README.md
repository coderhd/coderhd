## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Harsh, a software engineer based in Bengaluru, who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop websites and web applications that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

Shortly after graduating from Gujarat Technological University, I joined the development team at Ashutec Solutions, where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Currently I work at American Express, where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.
